You need to download some files to follow this lesson by yourself:

- Download [data-shell.zip](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/data-shell.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.
- Unzip or extract the file. You should end up with a new directory called data-shell on your Desktop.
- Open a terminal and type `cd`, then press the Enter key. That last step will make sure you start with your home directory as your working directory.
