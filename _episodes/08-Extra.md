# File permissions
Unix controls who can read, modify, and run files using concepts of *file ownership* and *permissions* to provide security at the file system level.  Using Pawsey systems will require knowledge of unix permissions.   

Users can belong to any number of groups, each of which has a unique group name and numeric group ID.* Every file and directory on a Unix computer belongs to one owner and one group. Along with each file’s content, the operating system stores the numeric IDs of the user and group that own it.

The user-and-group model means that for each file every user on the system falls into one of three categories: 1) the owner of the file, 2) someone in the file’s group, and 3) everyone else.

To discover the permissions and associated group for any file / directory use the command 'ls -l' 

~~~
$ ls -l
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
drwxrwxr-x 7 lukeedwards lukeedwards   4096 Sep 15  2017 data-shell
~~~
{: .output}


The output above represents:

* 1) set of ten permission flags
* 2) link count (irrelevant to this topic)
* 3) owner
* 4) associated group
* 5) size
* 6) date of last modification
* 7) name of file

For the ten permission flags (drwxrwxr-x)

Position   |   Meaning
----|----
1	        |  "d" if a directory, "-" if a normal file
2, 3, 4	  |  read, write, execute permission for user (owner) of file
5, 6, 7	  |  read, write, execute permission for group
8, 9, 10	 |  read, write, execute permission for other (everyone)

* **Read** access would allow you to open and view a file.  Users can view contents of a directory and list (ls) contents of directory
- **Write** access would allow you to modify a file (e.g. edit, rename or delete)
+ **Execute** access would allow 'execute' a file.  Relevant for files that are scripts etc.  For directories, it also allows you enter directory with 'cd' command  


> ## How do you change permissions?
>
> We use the *chmod* command.  The chmod command specifies read-write-execute permissions for the user, and 
> read-execute permissions for group and other.
>
> It can be applied recusively to directories using the '-R' option.  Octal values or symbolic representations of the flags can be used to change permissions
>
> ### Octal
>
> Octal digit | Permission | Binary representation (rwx)
> --- | --- | ---
> 7 | read, write and execute | 111
> 6 | read and write | 110
> 5 | read and execute | 101
> 4 | read only | 100 
> 3 | write and execute | 011
> 2 | write only | 010
> 1 | execute only | 001
> 0 | none | 000
> 
> 4 = read , 2 = write , 1 = execute

> ### Symbolic
>
> | Reference | Class | Description |
> | --- | --- | --- | 
> | u | user | file's owner |
> | g | group | members of the file's group |
> | o | others | users who are niether file's owner or members of file's group |
> | a | all | all three of the above |
>
> | Operator | Description |
> | --- | --- |
> | + | adds the specified modes from specific classes |
> | - | removes the specified modes from the specified classes |
> | = | the modes specified are to be made the exact modes for the specified classes |
>
> e.g. *chmod a-w* 
> remove write (w) permissions for all classes (a), preventing anyone from writing to the file
>
>
> Let's create a file, say permissions.txt and experiment with changing permissions

> **Pawsey example**  - To move data via the command line a python command line client called *pshell* is used.  The first step is to ensure the user has *execute* permission.  This is done via *chmod u+x pshell* - see more [How to use pshell](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Using+the+command+line+interface+-+pshell).

# Transferring files

### SCP
Secure copy protocol (SCP) is a means of securely transferring files between a local host and remote host (or two remote hosts).  To copy a file, we specify the source and destination paths, either of which may include computer names. If we leave out a computer name, scp assumes we mean the machine we’re running on.  Syntax is the following:

~~~
scp [options] username1@source_host:directory1/filename1 username2@destination_host:directory2/filename2
~~~

To copy a directory (and all the files it contains), use scp with the -r option. This tells scp to recursively copy the source directory and its contents.  You can also use wildcards (* or ?) as discussed earlier.

### Wget
Wget is a simple tool developed for the GNU Project that downloads files with the HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols. It is widely used by Unix-like users and is available with most Linux distributions.  Useful for automated download of large amounts of data and is supported by [Pawsey Data Portal](https://data.pawsey.org.au/)

# Other useful information

### SSH

If we want to run some commands on another machine, such as a Pawsey supercomputer or virtual machine, we have to first log into that machine. We call this a 'remote login'.

In order for us to be able to login, the remote computer must be runing a remote login server and we will run a client program that can talk to that server. The client program passes our login credentials to the remote login server and, if we are allowed to login, that server then runs a shell for us on the remote computer.

Once our local client is connected to the remote server, everything we type into the client is passed on, by the server, to the shell running on the remote computer. That remote shell runs those commands on our behalf..

To make a remote login, we issue the following syntax 'ssh username@remote_host' 

The remote host is the IP address or domain name that you are trying to connect to 

~~~
bash-3.2$ 
bash-3.2$ ssh username@magnus.pawsey.org.au
Password: ********
~~~
{: .language-bash}

SSH keys allow for a secure method of logging in to a server without the need of typing a password each time a connection is established.  This method has many advantages and is the only method to login to your Virtual Machine (VM) on Pawsey's Cloud Service - Nimbus.  Details on creating keypairs for Nimbus are here: [Making keypairs](https://pawseysc.github.io/using-nimbus/04-making-keypairs/index.html)

### Sudo
'sudo' is a program that allows users to run programs with the security privilages of another user, usually 'superuser' with 'root' access.  Short for '**su**peruser **do**' or '**su**bstitute user **do**'  


This is useful for when you temporarily want elevated privilages, which is common when using a Nimbus Virtual Machine.  See more at [Using Nimbus: Cloud computing at Pawsey](https://pawseysc.github.io/using-nimbus/)

### Data science
Often 'data science' makes use of text files and text-based Comma Separated Values (CSV) files.  Unix commands that we have learnt in the training (wc, head, tail, cat, grep, uniq) can be used to modify and process large files that you couldn't do in popular software packages

Here is a [link](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/shell-commands-data-scientist) to how to use 8 common Unix commands in Data Science

### Awk
Previously in the 'Pipes and Filters' episode, basic text processing commands were introduced.  The 'awk' command (short for 
**A**ho, **W**einberger, and **K**ernighan) is a more powerful method for processing or analyzing text files, in particular, data files that are organized by lines (rows) and columns.  

The basic format of an awk command looks like this:
~~~
awk 'pattern {action}' input-file > output-file
~~~
{: .language-bash}

It is an interpreted programming language which focuses on processing text and is a direct predecessor of [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl)
